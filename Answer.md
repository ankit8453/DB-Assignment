Relationship Between “Product” and “Product_Category” Entities:
In the given database schema diagram, the “Product” and “Product_Category” entities are related through a foreign key relationship.
Specifically, the “Product” entity has an attribute called “category_id,” which serves as a foreign key referencing the primary key of the “Product_Category” table.
This relationship indicates that each product in the “Product” table is associated with a specific category defined in the “Product_Category” table.
In other words, the “category_id” in the “Product” table points to the corresponding category in the “Product_Category” table.
Ensuring Valid Category Assignment:
To ensure that each product in the “Product” table has a valid category assigned, consider the following steps:
Data Integrity Constraints: Implement data integrity constraints in the database schema. Specifically:
Set the “category_id” column in the “Product” table as a foreign key referencing the primary key (“category_id”) in the “Product_Category” table.
Use the NOT NULL constraint to ensure that every product must have a valid category assigned (i.e., the “category_id” cannot be null).
Validation Logic in Application Code:
When inserting or updating product records, validate that the provided “category_id” corresponds to an existing category in the “Product_Category” table.
If the category is not valid, reject the operation or prompt the user to select a valid category.
Regular Data Audits:
Periodically audit the data to identify any inconsistencies (e.g., products with invalid or non-existent category IDs).
Correct any discrepancies found during the audit process.
